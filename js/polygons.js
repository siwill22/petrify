/*
 * Reconstructed polygons: continents, terranes, coastlines.
 *
 * Rigid bodies, so the geometry arrives ONCE at its present-day position with an Euler
 * pole and angle per plate per time, and this rotates it. Shipping reconstructed geometry
 * per frame would mean tens of thousands of vertices times hundreds of frames; here it is
 * one matrix per plate per frame and a matrix multiply per vertex.
 *
 * ---- Why filling does not use tracePolyline -------------------------------------------
 *
 * tracePolyline lifts the pen where a line passes behind the horizon, which is right for a
 * line and wrong for a filled shape: an open path closes itself with a straight chord, so
 * a continent straddling the limb would fill as a lens across the globe.
 *
 * It IS used for the one case that cannot be filled at all -- a ring straddling a flat
 * map's seam, which is outlined instead. That is not an exception to the reasoning above
 * so much as a consequence of it: where a closed path is guaranteed wrong, a line is the
 * honest thing to draw, and then tracePolyline is exactly the right tool.
 *
 * Instead, a vertex behind the horizon is CLAMPED onto the limb -- the component of the
 * vertex perpendicular to the view axis, nudged just inside the visible side. The ring
 * stays continuous, the fill closes along the limb where it should, and nothing can spill
 * off the disc because every clamped point lands exactly on it.
 *
 * This costs the projector one extra capability, `axis`. Without it the layer draws
 * outlines only, since there is no way to know where the limb is.
