/*
 * Symbolised point datasets, with hit-testing.
 *
 * This is the first layer in the library that answers "what is under the pointer?", which
 * is what makes a map explorable rather than only looked-at. The answer has to agree with
 * what is on screen, so picking reads the SAME projected positions that draw() just
 * computed rather than recomputing them -- if the two ever disagree, the popup describes a
 * symbol other than the one under the cursor, and that is invisible in a screenshot.
 *
 * ---- Two transports -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Points are rigid bodies with correspondence across time -- a deposit is the same deposit
 * at 0 and 250 Ma, just somewhere else. (Resolved topologies are not, which is why
 * boundary frames cut hard while these interpolate.) So positions can be shipped two ways:
 *
 *   'rotations'   present-day position per point + an Euler pole/angle per PLATE per time.
 *                 Cost scales with plates x times.
 *   'trajectory'  a reconstructed position per point per time. Scales with points x times.
 *
 * Which is smaller is a property of the dataset, not a matter of taste -- roughly,
 * rotations win once `effective_points > 2 x distinct_plates`. Both are read here behind
 * one API so a consumer can switch without touching page code, and so the two can be
 * compared against each other.
 *
 * ---- Appearance through time ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A point exists from its `age` to the present. The two transports encode that
 * differently -- trajectory writes null coordinates, rotations carries a scalar age -- so
 * both paths are normalised to the same `_live` flags here.

   * but land on opposite sides of that cut once projected -- most visibly once Map
   * Orientation (an oblique aspect) moves the cut somewhere the data crosses often, rather
   * than the antimeridian a dataset was curated to avoid. Not implemented by calling
   * `tracePolyline()` itself: that helper draws one flat stroke colour per call, and this
   * needs `this._style[prev].fill` to vary per segment (a caller's style hook produces a
   * gradient along the sequence) -- so the seam break is inlined here instead, walking the
